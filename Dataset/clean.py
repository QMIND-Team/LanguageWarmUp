You will start with:
Raw messy data.  Hard to work with.  Bleh
You can read directly from `Yelp.txt` in this folder!
You will want to end up with:
Nice, tokenized data, preferably in a Pandas dataframe!
'''






'''
Some ideas/questions:
How will you read the data into python?  (Pandas preferred!)
What needs to be cleaned out?  Punctuation?
How can we tokenize it?  Does something have that built in?
